# Store your project details here in YAML format.
# Edit this file to add, remove, or modify projects.
# GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild the site when this file changes.

# Notes on YAML format:
# - Indentation (use 2 spaces) is crucial.
# - Use '-' for list items.
# - Use 'key: value' pairs.
# - Strings don't usually need quotes unless they contain special characters.
# - For multi-line strings (like fullDescription), use '|' or '>'.
#   '|' preserves newlines, '>' folds newlines into spaces (use '|' for HTML).
