# project.html # This page will display details for a single project. 
# It needs logic to find the project based on the URL parameter. 
# Jekyll doesn't directly support URL parameters easily for static generation. 
# # Option 1 (Recommended): Use a Jekyll Collection 
# - Create a `_projects` folder. 
# - Put each project in its own Markdown file (e.g., _projects/analytics-dashboard.md). 
# - Use front matter in the Markdown file for metadata (title, category, image, etc.). 
# - The content of the Markdown file becomes the full description. 
# - Configure the collection in _config.yml to generate pages at /projects/project-name/. 
# - Link cards on index.html directly to these generated pages. 
# # Option 2 (JavaScript-based): Keep using URL parameter `?id=` 
# - This page (`project.html`) is generated once by Jekyll. 
# - It includes ALL project data (e.g., `site.data.projects | jsonify`) in a JavaScript variable. 
# - JavaScript reads the `?id=` from the URL on page load. 
# - JavaScript finds the matching project in the data and dynamically populates the HTML. 
# - This is similar to the previous non-Jekyll approach but uses Jekyll to embed the data. 
# # This example implements Option 2 (JavaScript-based) as it's closer to the previous structure. 
# Option 1 (Collections) is generally preferred for cleaner URLs and better SEO in Jekyll. layout: default 
# Use the default layout title: Project Details 
# Title will be updated by JS custom_js: 
# List any JS files needed specifically for this page - /assets/js/project-detail.js
